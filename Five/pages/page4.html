		<h4 class="why">Why This Song</h4>
		<p>This is one of the slowest tracks on the album Young Thug released over the summer. Although the album in a whole was a switch-up from his regular hard-hitting, spastic rap (which don't get me wrong, I love), it was nice to hear a softer side of Thugger. "Me Or Us" revolves around his current relationship and I wasn't able to truly appreciate the lyrics until recently. If this was done by any other artist I wouldn't think it was anything more than pretty, but Young Thug gets on proves he can rap over anything and for that reason, it comes in as one of my favorites.</p>

		<p class="lyrics-text"><em>...text anymore... so what're you recording?</em><br>
It's a new song, I'ma let you hear a little bit<br>
Play it<br><br>
Well this is why-a-why-a-why<br>
Well this is why-a-why-a-why<br>
Well this is why-a-why-a-why<br><br>
Who you loyal to? Me or us?<br>
Who you trust the most? Me or us?<br>
Who you wanna fuck every night? Me or us?<br>
Who you wanna take on your flight? Me or us?<br><br>
Ow!<br>
You the one that said you were doin' it<br>
And you said you were doin' it, you're doin' it, you're doin' it<br>
You say that what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'<br>
You told me that what, what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'<br>
But what you do if your brother left you?<br>
What would you do if them niggas came for you?<br>
You better pursue (watch out)<br>
I just spent 10 racks on a dog from Germany, no Purdue<br>
Oops, I meant Dupree, jury sittin' on their seat<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I wanna know, tell me, lil' baby, I wanna know<br>
I wanna know<br>
<span class="highlight">I got the show, fuck my show, be my show</span><br>
(What)<br>
I got them loafs, I'm with Metro, he got some more (yeah)<br>
I don't gotta talk<br>
Nigga, my jewelry, it can say more, hey<br>
You smoke that kush and man I'm so good and I want some cookies<br>
Fuck on your daughter, fuck on my brother<br>
Now she gon' diss you<br>
I got them racks, I was just buyin'<br>
You was just lookin'<br>
I bought her diamonds and she just smilin'<br>
She think she tooken, but<br>
This one is all for my fans<br>
I'm smokin' pow-wow in Japan<br>
Blacker the berry, drink my cran<br>
Bae you dig it? Understand<br>
<em>Humming</em><br>
Well this is why-a-why-a-why<br>
Well this is why-a-why-a-why<br>
Well this is why-a-why-a-why<br>
