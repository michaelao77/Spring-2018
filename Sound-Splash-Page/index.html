			<h4>Conception</h4>
		<p class="para">When  assigned to go out and hunt for sounds, my first instinct was to run to the bathroom.</p>
		<p class="para">I initially thought my sound experience was going to revolve around water, so I focused on capturing the sound of flushing toilets, running water, and other drip-drops of the  leaky pipes. I eventually made my way downstairs and around the halls to capture other sounds of interest.</p>
		<p class="para">This ended up being the bulk of my remix.</p>

			<h4>Process</h4>
		<p class="para">Once the sounds were captured and uploaded, I went through and renamed the files according to what I thought would be most helpful for me in editing.</p>
			<img class="pic-sm" src="images/files.png">

		<p class="para">After that, I started playing around with the program, snipping and mixing files, messing around with effects, etc.</p>
		
		<p class="para">Once I started getting the hang of things, I laid down all the tracks I thought I wanted to use, playing around with fades and overlapping to figure out how I wanted the files to interact.</p>

			<p class="caption">First step in editing. Trying to make somewhat of a beat.</p>
			<img class="pic" src="images/mid.png">
			<p class="caption">Midway through. Pretty messy and still not sounding too good. A lot of unnecessary  files and repetition.</p>

			<h4>Final Result</h4>
			<p class="para">After cleaning up my files, I was able to get a much better read on what thing worked and what didn't. I also finally felt comfortable enough in the program to be able to manupulate the files to sound how I wanted them to.</p>

		<p class="caption">All done. Realizing now it wasn't really necessary to put the clips in different tracks since there isn't much overlapping.</p>
